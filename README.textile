TourGuide is an interactive leveling guide addon.
It is designed to provide the user with a streamlined order of quest completion with smart detection.
It is also designed for easy creation of "guides" for users with little-to-no programming knowledge.

** Detect quest accept, completion and turnin

h2. How to create (or edit) guides

TourGuide data files are fairly simple to create.<br/>
The simplest method is to copy an existing file and edit it how you want.
Please read "How to edit TourGuide guides":http://www.tekkub.net/pages/tourguide_editing for help on the format and general guidelines.
I ask that all submissions follow these guidelines, to present a consistent format to the user.
I welcome all submissions, but reserve the right to edit them as I see fit, or reject ones that infringe upon Joana's, Kopp's or any other copyrighted guide.

See "this page":http://www.tekkub.net/pages/tourguide_bugs for details on how to fork my github repo to push your changes.

*_If you use Joana's or Kopp's as a source <u>do not</u> infringe on their copyrighted material (the notes and comments), I cannot accept guides that are a direct ripoff of their works._*
